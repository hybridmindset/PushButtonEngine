    /**
     * This demo is identical to the CirclePickupScene, but shows how we can use
     * the TimeManager instead of directly listening for ENTER_FRAME events.
     * 
     * Why would we want to do this?
     * 
     * Because the TimeManager gives us a better model for building our game's
     * simulation, one that works more reliably even if the game is running slow
     * or fast. It gives us two kinds of callbacks, ticks and frames. Ticks are
     * guaranteed to be run at 32Hz, so they are a good basis for building game
     * logic. Frames are called every time Flash renders, so they let us do
     * visual rendering in a specific place.
     * 
     * Using the TimeManager, we can also pause, slow down, or speed up our game's
     * logic without having to worry about our rendering code getting in the way.
     * 
     * The TimeManager also lets us assign a priority to things that listen to
     * frames or ticks, so that we can e.g. make sure scene rendering code
     * is run after all the individual bits of logic that update the positions
     * of all the things in the scene.
     * 
     * To demonstrate how this is handy, we get rid of the GemManager, and fold
     * its code right into the scene by implementing the ITicked interface and
     * adding ourselves to the TimeManager.
